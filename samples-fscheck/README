# Step-by-step FsCheck setup in F#

### Usage ###

Run `fsi.exe` and specify the filename of the script, so that F# interactive reads the code and executes the script in real time:

```
fsi samples-fscheck.fsx
```

-----

### Appendix ###

#### Why not `#load` the script inside F# interactive?####

Loading the script inside an F# interactive session *can* result in the following error:

```
# Assuming that `paket.exe` is not downloaded.

> #load "gistfile1.fsx";;
[Loading F:\gistfile1.fsx]

error FS0082: Could not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly
"paket.exe". Check to make sure the assembly exists on disk. If this reference
is required by your code, you may get compilation errors. (Code=MSB3245)
